                <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
                <p>Javascript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum fexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environemtnet (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the obects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><span class="type">Variable Declaration</span> Javascript variables are containers for storing data values - imaging a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All Javascript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="example">var x;</span></li>
                    <li><span class="type">Variable Assignment</span> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffeee pouirted in it, fibing our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assignes a calue to a variable. <span class="example">var x = 10</span></li>
                    <li><span class="type">Data Types</span> Data types are an inportant conceptl to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span class="example">true</span> or <span class="example">false;</span> null - <span class="example">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class="example">42</span> or <span class="example">3.14159;</span> String - <span class="example">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span class="example">[1, 'Coding',2,'Dojo');</span> and Object - <span class="example">{first_name: 'Jane',last)name:'Doe'}</span></li>
                    <li><span class="type">Conditionals</span> When you write code, you want to peform different actions for deffierent decisions - hitting different code blcoks based on values or conditions that have been met, You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. THere are the followinciong condtional statements: <span class="example">if</span> a specifced confictoion is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="example">else if</span> to specific a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="example">else</span> we execute this vlock of code;</li>
                    <li><span class="type">Loops</span> There are many different kdinds of kips in every progbramming language, byt they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action sime number of times. Imaging you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
                    <li><span class="type">Function</span> Functions are an excapsulation of a code block. When we call our fucntion this will run that code blcok. Thik of it as a list of instructions. As an example imaging we are putting togehter a deks from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the lefts to the table topl next we place the table the right way uyp. Done! We findshed our instrciotns. Sadly there are a tome more tables to do so lets call our fucntions vore and over and over again. </li>
